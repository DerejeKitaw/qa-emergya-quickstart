 * In this class we will include all the page objects that we will need as protected parameters
 * However, we have a very interesting constructor. This constructor class to its parent DefaultTestSet
 * and then executes the method before from its parent class DefaultTest which will the method that will initialize
 * the driver like in the project. But in this case, we have to do these actions here to provide a functional
 * driver, why?
 * This is the class that all our classes that define steps for our feature files (all our step definition classes)
 * must extend.
